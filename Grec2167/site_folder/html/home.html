	<h3>My name is Natalia and Welcome to my Website!</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
	I was born and raised in Ukraine, in the city of Odessa. The city is located on the Black Sea coast and is a tourist place. Odessa is famous for its architecture, for example, the Opera and Ballet Theatre is magnificent not only inside but also outside. After graduation from high school, I went to study at the Christian University of Humanities and Economics and got a diploma in Human Resource Management. I also have a second diploma in Tourism and Hospitality Management.

	After my family moved to the United States I started work as Electrical Assembler in small company. This kind of job was totally new for me, but it is always interesting to get new experience. Then, I worked for The Boeing Company as Assembler Installer Electrical Systems B. It is breathtaking to work inside a plane and see how a metal frame transform into a real plane. I was laid off because of lack of work, but at the same time I got a chance to change my career.

	Therefore, I am started my Web Development Certificate program at Edmonds Community College in the Fall of 2020. So now you can see my first website created during my Fall quarter.
	This is my Final Project for this quarter, it shows how I learned the material and how I can apply what I have learned.
	I am sure that this college course will give me the necessary knowledge to successfully start my new career. Also, it will let me be a professional in the field of Web Development.

	<h3>Reflections about this Course</h3><hr>
	</div>
	<p>
	I would like to thank you for teaching us this quarter! The course - CIS 241 Web Development I - covers a lot of information about how to use tags, forms, HTML, CSS3, tables, how to work with GUI HTML editors and GitHub. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I really liked the practice labs and I would like there to be more in the future in my studying way. I think that it is only through practical lessons the student can learn the material more easily, and when the day of the final project comes, the student will say "I know how to do this, I have done it before!".
	</p>
	<p>
	For a very long time I was interested in the topic of creating websites, but I did not know what exactly to start to learn and how could I know if I was on the right way. Almost all the information obtained during this course was new for me. I found out that the site has a structure; that a site validator can help to fix problems with code; that styles can be written not only in the HTML file, but also in the CSS that was created for this; I learned to create tables; and how to work with hyperlinks; practiced creating web forms; I have a lot useful links now, that will help me learn Web development better, such as 3schools.com.
	</p>
	<p>
	I know that I have a lot to learn, but I am already at the beginning of this long way to a career as a Web developer and further training will be even more interesting.
	I am sure my first site looks a little unprofessional, but this is my first website and I am happy! I know that over time my skills will improve and I have a lot to learn; and in a year, when I complete my Web Application Development course, my projects will look much better.
	</p>
	<p>Looking forward to the Winter quarter!
